# CS0441_Spring2020
This repository will hold any extra recitation materials for CS 0441 for the Spring 2020 term. 

Recitation 3 materials on Wednesday January 30th can be found in the '03' folder. 

Feel free to ignore the .tex files as they are Latex files that I wrote to generate the pdf. Latex is a programming language designed to generate math/science papers as they work very well for expressing formulas and other mathematical terms that can be hard to represent in something like Microsoft Word.
